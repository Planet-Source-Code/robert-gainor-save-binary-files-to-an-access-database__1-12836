This Project is an example of how to open a file into a byte array and
save that byte array to an Access database, and to extract binary data
from the Access database back into a byte array and save it back to a
file. This example uses .bmp and .jpg graphics files but with minor
modifications any type of file can be saved in binary format to a
database. again this is only an example application. I threw this
togethor in a couple of hours so there are some minor bugs in the code.
a little bit of error handling should clear them up.
Hope you find this usefull
